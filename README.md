## üí° About Me:
I am a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Cape Town. I am a highly-motivated and goal-oriented person with a wild curiosity which led me to my passion for electronics and programming. I am a well-balanced individual with not only academic prowess, but leadership and social skills as well, due to being in multiple positions of leadership. I am able to work either by myself or with others to efficiently produce only the best results in any task or situation, due to my problem-solving and networking skills. I have a specific interest in embedded systems, electronics, and computer science, and would love to pursue a career in the electronic research engineering field.
